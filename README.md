# Responsive UI Practice

## Overview

This repository contains a static web project developed as a focused exercise to enhance and demonstrate foundational front-end skills using HTML and CSS. The project features a responsive user interface for a simplified booking chat system, designed to adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes.

## Purpose

This project was created as a hands-on learning experience to:

* **Reinforce HTML5 Structure:** Practice effective and semantic structuring of web content.
* **Master CSS3 Styling & Layout:** Deepen understanding and application of advanced CSS concepts, including Flexbox and/or Grid for robust layout, custom styling, and visual effects.
* **Implement Responsive Design:** Gain practical experience in making web interfaces adaptable and user-friendly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices through media queries.
* **Develop Clean UI:** Focus on creating an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface purely with styling languages.

## Features

* **Responsive Layout:** The design automatically adjusts and optimizes its presentation for different device screen widths.
* **Simulated Chat Interface:** Visually represents a conversation flow, including message bubbles and user interactions.
* **Interactive-like UI Elements:** Incorporates visual elements that mimic interactive components, such as booking duration options.
* **Modern Aesthetic:** Designed with a clean and contemporary visual style.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring all elements and content on the page.
* **CSS3:** For all visual styling, layout management, and responsive adaptations.
    * *(Optional: You can specify particular CSS techniques here, e.g., "Utilizes Flexbox for component alignment and CSS Grid for overall page structure.")*
* **No JavaScript:** This project deliberately avoids JavaScript for its core functionality, demonstrating a pure HTML and CSS solution for the UI.
